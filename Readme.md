Currently this project only compiles less from the Themes\Theme1\Styles folder into the Themes\Theme1\Content\css folder.

Looking to make it so less can be compiled regardless of theme name, ie Themes\**\Styles.

So for example if a .less file is edited in Themes\Theme2\Styles folder, then updated .css should only be generated into Themes\Theme2\Content\css.
